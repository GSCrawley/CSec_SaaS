# Development Crew Platform

## Overview

The `development_crew/` directory contains all code, infrastructure, and documentation for the Development Crew: a general-purpose, modular AI agent platform.

- **Purpose:** Build agentic applications across any domain (not limited to cybersecurity)
- **Architecture:** Orchestration, Planning, Development, Operations agent layers
- **Integrations:** MCP servers, Neo4j knowledge fabric, project management tools (Jira, Notion, Figma)

## Directory Structure
- `agents/` — Specialized agent implementations
- `infrastructure/` — Core platform infrastructure (knowledge fabric, MCP servers, orchestration)
- `docs/` — Architecture, integration, and planning docs
- `repo-structure.md` — Detailed breakdown of the repo organization
- `requirements.txt` — Platform dependencies

## Integration with Applications
- This platform is designed to be reused for any agentic app.
- For example, the `../csec_saas/` directory contains a customizable Cybersecurity Incident Response SaaS app built using this platform.
- Application-specific code and documentation should reside outside `development_crew/` to preserve modularity.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Agnostic Architecture**: Adaptable to various industry domains beyond cybersecurity
- **Four-Layer Agent Structure**: Specialized agents for orchestration, planning, development, and operations
- **Knowledge Graph Foundation**: Neo4j-based knowledge sharing system to maintain project context
- **MCP Server Enhancement**: Each agent equipped with dedicated tools and capabilities
- **External Tool Integration**: Seamless connections with Figma, Jira, GitHub, and other development tools

## Next Steps

1. **Foundation Setup (Current Phase)**
   - Configure the development environment using the deployment kickoff checklist
   - Set up repository structure for the Development Crew project
   - Create initial documentation and project management resources

2. **Orchestration Layer Implementation**
   - Deploy Project Manager Agent to coordinate workflows
   - Implement Requirements Analyst Agent for parsing requirements
   - Configure Quality Assurance Agent for output validation

3. **Knowledge Fabric Setup**
   - Implement Neo4j knowledge graph with domain-agnostic schema
   - Create knowledge graph agent for maintaining shared context
   - Set up communication protocols between agents and knowledge fabric

4. **Planning Layer Implementation**
   - Deploy Architecture Agent for system design
   - Configure Security Architect Agent for security considerations
   - Implement UX Designer Agent for interface specifications
   - Set up Data Architect Agent for data modeling

5. **Development Layer Implementation**
   - Create Backend and Frontend Developer Agents
   - Implement Database Engineer Agent
   - Add Framework Specialist Agent
   - Configure ML Engineer Agent

6. **Operations Layer Implementation**
   - Configure DevOps Agent for CI/CD and infrastructure
   - Implement Security Operations Agent
   - Set up Documentation and Testing Agents

7. **Integration and Testing**
   - Verify cross-agent collaboration
   - Test end-to-end workflows across domains
   - Validate output quality and system performance
