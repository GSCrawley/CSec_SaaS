## Implementation Approach

Each agent is implemented as a containerized service with:

1. **LLM Foundation**: Based on Mixtral-8x7b-32768 or Claude 3 Opus
2. **Agent Framework**: Using the MCP-agent framework
3. **Tool Access**: RESTful API access to specialized tools
4. **Knowledge Graph Connection**: Direct connection to Neo4j
5. **Event System**: RabbitMQ-based event subscription for collaboration

The implementation follows these principles:

- **Modularity**: Each agent can be developed and deployed independently
- **Standardized Communication**: Consistent message formats between agents
- **Extensibility**: New capabilities can be added without disrupting existing ones
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of agent activities

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Priority**: 
   - First implement the Orchestration Layer agents
   - Then Knowledge Fabric integration
   - Followed by Planning Layer agents

2. **Domain Adaptability Testing**:
   - Test with cybersecurity domain (leveraging existing knowledge)
   - Extend to a new domain (e.g., healthcare) as validation

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Develop cross-agent workflows for common development tasks
   - Validate end-to-end information flow
   - Measure performance and optimize as needed
