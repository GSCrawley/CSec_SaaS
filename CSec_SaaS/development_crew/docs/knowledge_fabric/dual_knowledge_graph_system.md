# Dual Knowledge Graph System: Architecture & Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Dual Knowledge Graph (DKG) system is a foundational component of the Digital Genome architecture, enabling sophisticated knowledge management across multiple AI agents. It implements a two-tier knowledge architecture consisting of:

1. **Local Knowledge Graphs**: Agent-specific knowledge stores that contain specialized information relevant to each agent's domain and responsibilities.
2. **Global Knowledge Fabric**: A centralized, shared knowledge repository that facilitates cross-agent knowledge sharing, consistency, and collective intelligence.

This document serves as the authoritative reference for the DKG system's architecture, components, and functionality.

## Core Components

The DKG system consists of several interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities:

### 1. Managed Knowledge Graphs (`DKM_ManagedKG`)

Knowledge graphs that are actively managed by the Dual Knowledge Manager (DKM).

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Global** | The central, shared knowledge repository accessible to all agents | Global_Knowledge_Fabric |
| **Local** | Agent-specific knowledge stores containing specialized information | Local_Agent_KG_Example |

### 2. Synchronization Rules (`DKM_SynchronizationRule`)

Define how knowledge is synchronized between local and global knowledge graphs.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Bidirectional** | Synchronizes entities in both directions between local and global KGs | Bidirectional_Sync |
| **Unidirectional** (Local → Global) | Pushes selected entities from local KGs to the global fabric | LocalToGlobal_Sync |
| **Unidirectional** (Global → Local) | Pulls selected entities from the global fabric to local KGs | GlobalToLocal_Sync |

### 3. Schema Mappings (`DKM_SchemaMapping`)

Define how different knowledge representations are translated between graphs.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Entity** | Maps entity structures between local and global schemas | Entity_Mapping |
| **Relation** | Maps relationship structures between local and global schemas | Relation_Mapping |

### 4. Knowledge Policies (`DKM_KnowledgePolicy`)

Define governance rules for knowledge management.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Sharing** | Defines what knowledge can be shared between KGs and under what conditions | Sharing_Policy |
| **Access** | Defines which agents can access what knowledge and with what permissions | Access_Policy |

## Relationship Types

The DKG system uses the following relationship types to connect components:

| Relationship | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **SYNCS_WITH** | Indicates a bidirectional synchronization between two KGs | Local_Agent_KG_Example -[SYNCS_WITH]-> Global_Knowledge_Fabric |
| **SYNCS_TO** | Indicates a unidirectional synchronization from source to target | Local_Agent_KG_Example -[SYNCS_TO]-> Global_Knowledge_Fabric |
| **APPLIES_TO** | Connects a rule or policy to the KG it governs | Bidirectional_Sync -[APPLIES_TO]-> Global_Knowledge_Fabric |
| **MAPS_BETWEEN** | Connects a schema mapping to the KGs it translates between | Entity_Mapping -[MAPS_BETWEEN]-> Global_Knowledge_Fabric |
| **GOVERNS** | Connects a policy to the KG it governs | Sharing_Policy -[GOVERNS]-> Global_Knowledge_Fabric |

## Implementation Details

### Neo4j Schema

The DKG system is implemented in Neo4j with the following schema:

```cypher
// Node Labels
:DKM_ManagedKG
:DKM_SynchronizationRule
:DKM_SchemaMapping
:DKM_KnowledgePolicy

// Node Properties
name: String
type: String
description: String
created_at: Integer (timestamp)

// Relationship Types
:SYNCS_WITH
:SYNCS_TO
:APPLIES_TO
:MAPS_BETWEEN
:GOVERNS

// Relationship Properties
rule: String (for SYNCS_WITH and SYNCS_TO relationships)
```

### Cypher Queries for Common Operations

#### 1. Create a New Managed Knowledge Graph

```cypher
MERGE (kg:DKM_ManagedKG {name: "Agent_Name_KG", type: "Local", description: "Knowledge graph for Agent_Name"})
SET kg.created_at = timestamp()
RETURN kg
```

#### 2. Apply a Synchronization Rule

```cypher
MATCH (source:DKM_ManagedKG {name: "Agent_Name_KG"})
MATCH (target:DKM_ManagedKG {name: "Global_Knowledge_Fabric"})
MATCH (rule:DKM_SynchronizationRule {name: "LocalToGlobal_Sync"})
MERGE (source)-[:SYNCS_TO {rule: "push"}]->(target)
MERGE (rule)-[:APPLIES_TO]->(source)
RETURN source, target, rule
```

#### 3. Query All Knowledge Graphs

```cypher
MATCH (kg:DKM_ManagedKG)
RETURN kg.name, kg.type, kg.description
```

#### 4. Find Applicable Policies for a Knowledge Graph

```cypher
MATCH (kg:DKM_ManagedKG {name: "Agent_Name_KG"})
MATCH (policy:DKM_KnowledgePolicy)-[:GOVERNS]->(kg)
RETURN policy.name, policy.type, policy.description
```

## Dual Knowledge Manager (DKM)

The `DualKnowledgeManager` class is responsible for:

1. **Knowledge Graph Management**: Creating, updating, and deleting knowledge graphs
2. **Synchronization**: Implementing the rules for knowledge transfer between graphs
3. **Schema Translation**: Applying mappings to translate between different knowledge representations
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Ensuring that knowledge sharing and access adhere to defined policies

### Key Methods

```python
class DualKnowledgeManager:
    def create_knowledge_graph(self, name, type, description):
        """Create a new managed knowledge graph"""
        pass
        
    def synchronize(self, source_kg, target_kg, sync_rule):
        """Synchronize knowledge between two knowledge graphs"""
        pass
        
    def apply_schema_mapping(self, entity, source_schema, target_schema):
        """Apply a schema mapping to translate an entity between schemas"""
        pass
        
    def check_policy_compliance(self, entity, policy_type):
        """Check if an entity complies with a specific policy"""
        pass
```

## Integration with Digital Genome Architecture

The DKG system integrates with other components of the Digital Genome architecture:

1. **Event System**: Knowledge updates trigger events that can be captured by the Events Node
2. **Vector Storage**: Semantic search capabilities enhance knowledge retrieval
3. **Agent Architecture**: Agents interact with their local KGs and the global fabric through the DKM

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Policy Rules**: Implement more sophisticated policy rules using a rule engine
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Develop strategies for resolving conflicts during synchronization
3. **Temporal Knowledge**: Add support for temporal aspects of knowledge (versioning, validity periods)
4. **Inference Engine**: Integrate a reasoning engine to derive new knowledge from existing facts
5. **Distributed Knowledge Fabric**: Support for distributed knowledge graphs across multiple instances
