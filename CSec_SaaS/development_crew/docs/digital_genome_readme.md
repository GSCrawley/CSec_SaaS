# Digital Genome Architecture - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

The Digital Genome Architecture transforms the Development Crew project into a more adaptive, self-regulating system with enhanced cognitive capabilities. Phase 1 implementation establishes the foundation with dual knowledge architecture, event tracking, and associative memory systems.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Dual Knowledge Architecture

- **DualKnowledgeManager** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/core/dual_knowledge.py`)
  - Manages individual agent knowledge graphs and shared knowledge fabric
  - Implements bidirectional synchronization of knowledge
  - Handles conflict resolution between individual and shared knowledge

### 2. Events System

- **EventsNode** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/core/events_node.py`)
  - Provides real-time event tracking capabilities
  - Logs system events, agent actions, and workflow steps
  - Creates relationships between events and related nodes

- **EventProcessor** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/services/event_processor.py`)
  - Processes events asynchronously with a worker queue
  - Supports event handlers, filters, and correlation rules
  - Enables real-time pattern detection across events

### 3. Associative Memory

- **AssociativeMemory** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/core/associative_memory.py`)
  - Implements a context-aware memory system
  - Supports memory storage, recall, and association
  - Features time-based decay and importance-based prioritization
  - Provides various retrieval methods (by ID, content, context, type)

### 4. Knowledge Synchronization

- **KnowledgeSynchronizer** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/services/knowledge_synchronizer.py`)
  - Implements scheduled and priority-based synchronization
  - Manages synchronization between individual and shared knowledge graphs
  - Provides monitoring and status reporting for sync operations

### 5. Integration Facade

- **DigitalGenomeManager** (`infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/digital_genome_manager.py`)
  - Provides a unified interface to all Digital Genome components
  - Handles component lifecycle (initialization, start, stop)
  - Simplifies interaction with events, memory, and synchronization systems

## Testing and Demonstration

### Unit Tests

Unit tests for all components are provided in:
```
development_crew/tests/test_digital_genome_phase1.py
```

To run the tests:
```bash
cd development_crew
python -m unittest tests/test_digital_genome_phase1.py
```

### Demo Application

A demonstration application showcasing the Digital Genome Architecture is available:
```
development_crew/demo_digital_genome.py
```

To run the demo with individual knowledge graphs only:
```bash
cd development_crew
python demo_digital_genome.py
```

To run the demo with shared knowledge graph:
```bash
cd development_crew
python demo_digital_genome.py --shared
```

## Neo4j Configuration

The Digital Genome Architecture relies on Neo4j for knowledge storage. You can configure the connection using environment variables:

```bash
# Individual graph configuration
export NEO4J_URI="neo4j://localhost:7687"
export NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
export NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"

# Shared graph configuration (optional)
export NEO4J_SHARED_URI="neo4j://localhost:7688"
export NEO4J_SHARED_USERNAME="neo4j"
export NEO4J_SHARED_PASSWORD="password"
```

## Schema Extensions

The Digital Genome Architecture extends the knowledge graph schema with new node types and relationship types specific to the genomic architecture. These are defined in:
```
infrastructure/knowledge_fabric/core/schema.py
```

Key additions include:
- Event nodes for tracking system activity
- Memory nodes for associative memory
- Policy nodes for governance rules
- Workflow nodes for process definitions
- Red Flag nodes for system anomalies

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the next phases of implementation will focus on:

### Phase 2: Agent Transformation
- Transform base agent class to GenomicAgent
- Implement policy-based decision making
- Add self-regulation mechanisms
- Develop Autopoietic Network Manager for self-repair

### Phase 3: Cognitive Systems
- Implement Cognitive Network Manager for connection management
- Develop workflow optimization capabilities
- Create Service Workflow Manager for end-to-end management

### Phase 4: Communication System Enhancement
- Enhance event-driven communication
- Develop Red Flag Manager for anomaly detection and self-healing
