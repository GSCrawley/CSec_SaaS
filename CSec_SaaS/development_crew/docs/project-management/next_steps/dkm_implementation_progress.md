# DualKnowledgeManager Implementation Progress

## Current Status (May 28, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the `DualKnowledgeManager` class as part of Phase 2 of the Digital Genome architecture. This component is responsible for managing the dual-layer knowledge graph structure that includes individual agent knowledge graphs and the shared global knowledge fabric.

### Key Accomplishments:

1. **DualKnowledgeManager Core Functionality**:
   - Implemented knowledge graph management operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Created synchronization mechanisms between individual and shared knowledge graphs
   - Added schema mapping capabilities for knowledge translation
   - Implemented policy enforcement for access control

2. **Schema Updates**:
   - Enhanced the `NodeLabel` and `RelationshipType` enums to include DKM-specific labels and relationship types
   - Added support for new node types like `DKM_ManagedKG`, `DKM_SynchronizationRule`, `DKM_SchemaMapping`, and `DKM_KnowledgePolicy`

3. **Testing**:
   - Created a comprehensive test script that verifies the functionality of the DualKnowledgeManager
   - Successfully tested knowledge graph creation, synchronization rule application, and knowledge synchronization

### Technical Details:

- The DualKnowledgeManager maintains connections to Neo4j for both individual and shared knowledge graphs
- Synchronization rules define how knowledge flows between graphs (unidirectional, bidirectional)
- Schema mappings translate between different knowledge representations
- Policies enforce access control and knowledge sharing rules

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Continuation)

### 1. Integrate Vector Storage
- Implement text-to-vector conversion using Sentence Transformers
- Set up Neo4j Vector Indexes for efficient similarity search
- Add vector comparison using Cosine Similarity
- Enable semantic search capabilities in the knowledge fabric

### 2. Connect with Events Node
- Ensure knowledge updates trigger appropriate events
- Implement real-time event tracking and capturing
- Establish event flow between knowledge operations

### 3. Refactor Agent Architecture
- Update `BaseAgent` to `GenomicAgent` incorporating the dual knowledge architecture
- Implement policy-based decision-making
- Add self-regulation capabilities

### 4. Develop AutopoieticNetworkManager
- Implement self-repair mechanisms
- Add component deployment management
- Create system stability monitoring

## Current Challenges and Considerations

- The `delete_knowledge_graph` method needs enhancement to handle relationships properly
- Need to implement more robust error handling for synchronization operations
- Consider adding versioning for knowledge updates
- Explore optimization strategies for large-scale knowledge synchronization

This implementation aligns with the broader roadmap for the Digital Genome system, specifically addressing the Phase 2 objectives of refining the Knowledge Fabric and Event System.
