# Development Crew Project Management Toolchain

## Overview

This document outlines how we'll use project management and design tools (Figma, Jira, Notion, and Neo4j) to plan, track, and visualize the Development Crew project. These tools will help us maintain a structured approach to building our multi-domain AI agent system.

## Figma Integration

### Purpose
Figma will serve as our primary design and visualization tool for:
- System architecture diagrams
- Agent interaction flows
- User interfaces for monitoring and control
- Knowledge graph visualizations

### Setup Process
1. **Create Project Structure**
   - Main project file with shared components
   - Separate pages for different agent layers
   - Design system for consistent representation

2. **Architecture Visualization**
   ```
   /Development Crew
     /Architecture
       - System Overview
       - Agent Layers
       - Knowledge Fabric
       - Integration Points
     /Agent Designs
       - Orchestration Layer
       - Planning Layer
       - Development Layer
       - Operations Layer
     /Interface Designs
       - Monitoring Dashboard
       - Agent Configuration
       - Knowledge Graph Explorer
   ```

3. **Implementation Process**
   - Start with high-level architecture diagrams
   - Refine individual agent designs as they're implemented
   - Create interactive prototypes for key interfaces
   - Maintain design consistency across components

### Integration with Development
- Use Figma Developer API to programmatically access design assets
- Implement direct integration with agent development workflow
- Create design system tokens that can be directly used in implementation

## Jira Integration

### Purpose
Jira will serve as our project and task management system for:
- Feature tracking and development workflow
- Sprint planning and execution
- Bug tracking and resolution
- Release management

### Project Structure
1. **Project Hierarchy**
   ```
   Development Crew (Project)
     /Foundation (Epic)
       - Repository Structure (Story)
       - Knowledge Fabric Implementation (Story)
       - Orchestration Layer Setup (Story)
     /Agent Implementation (Epic)
       - Planning Layer Agents (Story)
       - Development Layer Agents (Story)
       - Operations Layer Agents (Story)
     /Integration (Epic)
       - Cross-Agent Workflows (Story)
       - Tool Integrations (Story)
       - Testing and Validation (Story)
   ```

2. **Workflow Configuration**
   - To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
   - Additional states for agent-specific phases
   - Integration with GitHub for code-related tasks

3. **Automation Rules**
   - Automatic transitions based on development status
   - Notifications for blocked tasks
   - Assignment based on agent specialization

### Implementation Tracking
- Create tickets for each agent implementation
- Track dependencies between agent capabilities
- Map user stories to specific agent functions
- Use epics to organize related development tasks

## Notion Integration

### Purpose
Notion will serve as our knowledge management and documentation system:
- Project documentation
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Knowledge base for domain-specific information
- Development guidelines and best practices

### Workspace Structure
1. **Main Pages**
   ```
   /Project Overview
     - Project Goals
     - Architecture
     - Roadmap
     - Team Structure
   /Documentation
     - Agent Specifications
     - Knowledge Graph Schema
     - API Documentation
     - Testing Guidelines
   /Development Guides
     - Getting Started
     - Environment Setup
     - Code Standards
     - Review Process
   /Domain Knowledge
     - Cybersecurity Domain
     - Healthcare Domain (future)
     - Finance Domain (future)
     - Additional Domains...
   ```

2. **Template System**
   - Agent specification template
   - Tool documentation template
   - Meeting notes template
   - Decision record template

3. **Integration Features**
   - Embed Figma designs directly in documentation
   - Link Jira tickets to specifications
   - Include code snippets with syntax highlighting
   - Create relationship diagrams for knowledge representation

### Documentation Workflow
- Create specification documents before implementation
- Update documentation in parallel with development
- Review documentation as part of the quality assurance process
- Keep domain knowledge sections updated with latest information

## Neo4j Knowledge Graph

### Purpose
Neo4j will serve as our knowledge representation system:
- Project component relationships
- Agent capability mapping
- Domain-specific knowledge representation
- Decision tracking and rationale

### Knowledge Graph Structure
1. **Core Entity Types**
   - Agents (with roles and capabilities)
   - Components (code modules and systems)
   - Requirements (functional and non-functional)
   - Domains (knowledge domains supported)
   - Decisions (architectural and implementation)

2. **Relationship Types**
   - IMPLEMENTS (Agent → Capability)
   - DEPENDS_ON (Component → Component)
   - BELONGS_TO (Component → Domain)
   - SATISFIES (Component → Requirement)
   - MADE_BY (Decision → Agent)

3. **Visualization and Querying**
   - Neo4j Browser for interactive exploration
   - Custom dashboard for team visibility
   - Predefined queries for common information needs
   - Integration with agent reasoning systems

### Development Integration
- Use knowledge graph as foundation for agent decision-making
- Store and retrieve project architecture information
- Track relationships between requirements and implementations
- Enable cross-domain knowledge transfer

## Cross-Tool Integration

### Figma → Notion
- Embed design frames in documentation
- Link specifications to visual designs
- Export wireframes directly to documentation

### Jira → Notion
- Link tickets to specification documents
- Create documentation tasks from Jira tickets
- Track documentation status alongside development

### Neo4j → Figma
- Generate architecture diagrams from knowledge graph
- Keep diagrams updated with latest relationships
- Visualize complex domain knowledge

### Jira → Neo4j
- Track implementation status in knowledge graph
- Relate tickets to affected components
- Map user stories to domain knowledge

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. Create Figma project with system architecture diagrams
2. Set up Jira project with initial epics and stories
3. Create Notion workspace with documentation templates
4. Initialize Neo4j database with core schema

### Phase 2: Foundation Development
1. Develop detailed designs for Orchestration Layer
2. Create documentation for foundation components
3. Set up tracking for initial development sprints
4. Populate knowledge graph with base architecture

### Phase 3: Full Toolchain Integration
1. Implement cross-tool automation
2. Create dashboards showing project status
3. Develop visualization of development progress
4. Establish workflows for maintaining documentation

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Quality
- Completeness (coverage of all components)
- Accuracy (alignment with implementation)
- Usefulness (supports development needs)
- Accessibility (easy to find and understand)

### Project Visibility
- Real-time progress tracking
- Dependency visualization
- Resource allocation clarity
- Decision-making transparency

### Knowledge Transfer
- Domain knowledge accessibility
- Learning curve reduction
- Cross-domain pattern identification
- Reusable component discovery

## Conclusion

This integrated toolchain approach ensures that our Development Crew project maintains high standards of documentation, visibility, and knowledge management. By connecting these tools—Figma, Jira, Notion, and Neo4j—we create a comprehensive environment for developing a sophisticated multi-domain AI agent system.
