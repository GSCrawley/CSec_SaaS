# Knowledge Fabric Architecture

## Overview

The Knowledge Fabric is the central nervous system of the Development Crew, providing shared context, memory, and reasoning capabilities across all agents. Built on Neo4j, it maintains relationships between project entities, tracks development decisions, and enables cross-domain reasoning.

## Core Components

### 1. Graph Database Structure

The Knowledge Fabric uses a Neo4j graph database with the following primary node types:

- **Domain**: Represents a specific knowledge or application domain (e.g., cybersecurity, healthcare)
- **Project**: A development initiative with specific goals and requirements
- **Component**: Modular parts of the system being developed
- **Requirement**: Functional and non-functional specifications
- **Pattern**: Reusable design and architecture patterns
- **Implementation**: Actual code or configurations
- **Decision**: Key architectural or development decisions
- **Agent**: References to the AI agents in the Development Crew

Key relationships between these entities include:

- `BELONGS_TO`: Links entities to their parent domain or project
- `DEPENDS_ON`: Captures dependencies between components
- `IMPLEMENTS`: Shows which components implement which requirements
- `USES_PATTERN`: Associates components with design patterns
- `MADE_BY`: Links decisions to agents who made them
- `SATISFIES`: Shows how implementations fulfill requirements

### 2. Knowledge Access Layer

The Knowledge Access Layer provides a standardized interface for agents to query and update the knowledge graph:

```python
class KnowledgeAccessLayer:
    def query_entities(entity_type: str, properties: Dict) -> List[Entity]:
        """Query entities based on type and properties"""
        pass
        
    def create_entity(entity_type: str, properties: Dict) -> Entity:
        """Create a new entity in the knowledge graph"""
        pass
        
    def create_relationship(source_id: str, target_id: str, relationship_type: str, properties: Dict) -> Relationship:
        """Create a relationship between entities"""
        pass
        
    def search_path(start_id: str, end_id: str, relationship_types: List[str]) -> List[Path]:
        """Find paths between entities through specified relationships"""
        pass
```

### 3. Context Management

The Context Management component maintains the current state of development projects:

- **Active Context**: The current focus of the agent team
- **Context History**: Past contexts and transitions
- **Context Dependencies**: Related contexts that influence decisions

### 4. Memory Systems

The Knowledge Fabric implements three types of memory:

1. **Working Memory**: Short-term storage for active development tasks
2. **Episodic Memory**: Record of past development activities and decisions
3. **Semantic Memory**: Long-term storage of domain knowledge and patterns

## Integration with Agents

### Agent Access Patterns

Each agent layer interacts with the Knowledge Fabric differently:

1. **Orchestration Layer**:
   - Queries project status and dependencies
   - Updates task assignments and priorities
   - Manages context transitions

2. **Planning Layer**:
   - Retrieves and applies design patterns
   - Creates architecture components and relationships
   - Records design decisions with rationales

3. **Development Layer**:
   - Queries component specifications
   - Updates implementation status
   - Creates code-level dependencies

4. **Operations Layer**:
   - Retrieves deployment configurations
   - Updates system status and metrics
   - Records operational events

### Communication Protocol

Agents interact with the Knowledge Fabric through:

1. **Direct Queries**: Synchronous requests for specific information
2. **Event Subscriptions**: Asynchronous notifications of relevant changes
3. **Batch Updates**: Efficient bulk modifications to the knowledge graph

## Domain Adaptability

The Knowledge Fabric is designed to be domain-agnostic but extensible for specific domains:

### Domain Schema Extensions

For each supported domain, the Knowledge Fabric can be extended with:

- **Domain-Specific Entities**: New node types relevant to the domain
- **Specialized Relationships**: Domain-specific connections between entities
- **Property Extensions**: Additional attributes for existing entity types

### Example: Cybersecurity Domain Extension

```
// Cybersecurity domain extension for Neo4j
CREATE (:DomainExtension {name: "Cybersecurity"})

// Create domain-specific node labels
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (t:Threat) ASSERT t.id IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (v:Vulnerability) ASSERT v.cve_id IS UNIQUE

// Create domain-specific relationship types
CALL apoc.schema.relationship.create(['EXPLOITS', 'MITIGATES', 'DETECTS'])
```

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Neo4j**: Primary graph database
- **py2neo**: Python interface for Neo4j
- **FastAPI**: API layer for agent communication
- **Redis**: For caching and performance optimization
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization

### Deployment Architecture

The Knowledge Fabric is deployed as a set of containerized services:

- **Core Graph Service**: Manages the Neo4j database
- **Query Service**: Handles complex queries and caching
- **Update Service**: Manages consistent graph updates
- **Schema Service**: Maintains and evolves the graph schema

### Scaling Considerations

For large-scale projects, the Knowledge Fabric can be scaled by:

- **Graph Partitioning**: Splitting the graph across multiple database instances
- **Read Replicas**: Creating read-only copies for improved query performance
- **Query Optimization**: Using specialized indices for common access patterns

## Security and Governance

### Access Control

The Knowledge Fabric implements role-based access control:

- **Agent-Specific Permissions**: Each agent has specific read/write permissions
- **Operation Logging**: All graph modifications are logged
- **Schema Governance**: Changes to the graph schema require orchestration approval

### Data Validation

To maintain knowledge integrity:

- **Schema Validation**: Ensures entities match their defined schemas
- **Relationship Constraints**: Enforces valid relationships between entities
- **Property Validation**: Validates property values against their specifications

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Fabric provides a powerful foundation for the Development Crew, enabling collaborative development across domains while maintaining context and facilitating knowledge reuse. Its flexible design accommodates new domains while preserving consistent access patterns for all agents.
